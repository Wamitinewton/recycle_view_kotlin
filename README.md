## Android RecyclerView in Kotlin

A RecyclerView is an advanced version of ListView with improved performance. 

When you have a long list of items to show you can use RecyclerView. 
It has the ability to reuse its views. 
In RecyclerView when the View goes out of the screen or not visible to the user it wonâ€™t destroy it, it will reuse these views. 
This feature helps in reducing power consumption and providing more responsiveness to the application.
